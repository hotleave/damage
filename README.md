# Mage and Minions Champion Points Distribution & DPS

Thanks for [this thread](https://forum.makingfun.com/showthread.php?14948-CP-distribution-amp-DPS-(Update-of-existing-thread)). But the web page is very difficult to use,
and you have to calculate the weapon damage yourself. It's not convenient;

So I write a little Javascript application, and can be run in your favorite browser.


## How to use

> Note: When you filling the the value of `Power`, `Critical Rating`, `Critical Damage` and `Attack Speed` value, you need to reset the Champion Points of Offense first.

- download the zip

- unzip it

- double click the `damage.html`

- fill the values

- click `Calculate` button, and it will show you how to distribute the champion points of offense
